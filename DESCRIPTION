Description: Provides functions to analyze the spatial distribution of
    biodiversity, in particular categorical analysis of neo- and paleo-endemism
    (CANAPE) as described in Mishler et al (2014) <doi:10.1038/ncomms5473>.
    'canaper' conducts statistical tests to determine the types of endemism that
    occur in a study area while accounting for the evolutionary relationships of
    species.
