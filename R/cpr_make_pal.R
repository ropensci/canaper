#' Make a palette of colors for plotting CANAPE results
#'
#' Palettes with the name 'mishler2014' correspond to colors used in Mishler et
#' al. 2014. This color scheme has been widely used since to show CANAPE
#' results, but some colors may not be distinguishable to people with
#' color vision deficiency (CVD).
#' 
#' Palettes with the name 'canaper1' or 'canaper2' are based on the Okabe-Ito
#' palette and should be more CVD-friendly.
#'
#' @param name Character vector of length 1; name of palette to select. Must be
#' one of 'misher2014', 'canaper1', or 'canaper2'
#' @param type Character vector of length 1; type of palette to select. Must be
#' one of 'endem' (endemism) or 'signif' (*p*-rank significance)
